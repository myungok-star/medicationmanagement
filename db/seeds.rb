# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# # Wipe the database
# School.destroy_all
# Medication.destroy_all
#
# School.create([
#   {
#     name: "School 1"
#   },
#   {
#     name: "School 2"
#   }
# ])
#
# Medication.create([
#   {
#     name: "Med 1",
#     quantity: "10",
#     school_id: 1
#   },
#   {
#     name: "Med 2",
#     quantity: "3",
#     school_id: 1
#   },
#   {
#     name: "Med 3",
#     quantity: "8",
